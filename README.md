# Inspirest - Project 2

## Introduction
Welcome to Inspirest - definitely not Pinterest! - the place to inspire! This website will allow users to save images from the web and to classify them in boards and allow other users to view them!

Inspirest website - [https://flask-project2.onrender.com]

## How To Use This Website.
Users logging into the website will have access to browse images that from public available boards. What are boards you ask? Boards are webpages where logged in users will have access to add / edit / delete posts or pins from their created boards which will display a series of images related to a topic. An ideas board, to inspire creativity!

Private boards will require users to login first to get access to them. Creating a board will require users to login and will not be available to guests. Search will search for keywords / phrases through all posts found in all boards and display them in th search page.

Users who created the boards will be able to go to the board page and add new posts to it. While each post has an edit/delete button to modify the data. There is an About page to summarise this information for the user without having to go to the .README as well. Private boards also will allow the creator to share the boards with other users in the website.

## Features for Future Updates
* A search function that actually allows users to search through boards they have access to.
* Allow other users with access to read and write permissions to private boards.
* Popup window for signup / sign in.
* More CSS to make the website more visually appealing.
* Cleanup the routes by adding models to streamline the code.
* Sort functionality
* Delete created boards functionality

## Conclusion
At first learning python and flask was very stressful as I was having trouble understanding routes and how to direct them to access databases. After this project I felt like I had a solid understanding of how things worked, feeling this task was a lot easier to grasp than project 1.

I wish I had more time to add all the features I wanted, but I felt like the MVP was delivered and hopefully and then some. Although I can't be able to explain sessions and cookies and restful APIs and such to a friend or colleague, I hope with the next project and more time understanding the relationship between servers and the web will only sharpen my understanding.

Understanding how functions take in parameters to be used inside the function body was great as I was using the form with a hidden name to retrieve specific data from the database when I could have used the parameters from the web address. I believe there is some code in my project that definitely could have been stripped away and unnecessary after learning this, but I did not want to break my project before submission.

With Sean's help I was able to clean up my weblinks so they were more understandable by using javascript functions on buttons. I do not take credit for this although I think I understand how they work. Daunting for the next project.
